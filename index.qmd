<!-- Background container for the animated neural network.  The Vanta.js
     script targets this element to draw moving nodes and lines across
     the entire viewport. The CSS positions it fixed behind all content. -->

<!-- Custom navigation bar with our brand and page links.  We avoid
     Quarto's built‑in navigation so we have complete control over the
     appearance and behaviour. -->
